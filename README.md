# SideQuest AI 🎮

> **Never forget where you left off.**
> An intelligent gaming companion that logs your sessions and generates AI
> progress summaries — so you can pick up any game right where you stopped.

SideQuest connects to your game library, keeps a timeline of your play sessions,
and uses AI to summarize *what you were doing* and *what's next* — so coming back
to a game after weeks away takes seconds, not a frustrating "wait, where was I?".

🔗 Try the demo: a public, pre-filled account is available — no signup required.

## Features

- **Steam library import** — bring in your games and playtime via your SteamID64.
- **Resume my game** — AI-generated progress summaries tell you exactly where you left off.
- **Session timeline** — every session logged, per game.
- **Smart recommender** — "What should I play this weekend?" based on your library and mood.
- **Profile & stats** — your gaming identity at a glance.
- **Roast mode** — a playful AI take on your gaming habits.
- **Desktop overlay** *(in progress)* — a lightweight Electron overlay that runs alongside your games.

> 🔒 **Privacy:** screenshots are never stored. They're sent to the vision model
> in memory and discarded — only the text summary is kept.
